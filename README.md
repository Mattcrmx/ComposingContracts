# ComposingContracts

This repository reproduces the library introduced in the paper https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/357766.351267 by S. Peyton-Jones and al.

At this stage, only some elementary operations are implemented, up until the second section of the paper.

## Building the code
If you're not familiar with *cabal* https://github.com/haskell/cabal to build the repository and run the executables, run the following :
`cabal build`
`cabal run`

Beware, you need to have a version of ghc that install the **base** package with a version greater than 4.14.3.0.


This is a wok in progress and it's also my shot at learning **Haskell** ! So don't hesitate to comment if you see potential improvements !
